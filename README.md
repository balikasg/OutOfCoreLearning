# Out Of Core Learning

Out-of-core (or "external memory") learning is a technique used to learn from data that cannot fit in a computerâ€™s main memory (RAM).
The idea of the presentation is to show methods and practices in order to scale in terms of memory.
The main principles concern ways to update data structures on the fly. The motivation lies in the fact that 
i) RAM becomes cheaper, 
ii) Talent to set up hadoop/spark etc. costs
iii) Most of the times the data used to apply machine learning actually fit in the RAM.
